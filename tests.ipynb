       "'Most of my kindergarten students come from low-income households and are considered \\\\\"at-risk\\\\\". These kids walk to school alongside their parents and most have never been further than walking distance from their house. For 80% of my students, English is not their first language or the language spoken at home. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhile my kindergarten kids have many obstacles in front of them, they come to school each day excited and ready to learn. Most students started the year out never being in a school setting. At the start of the year many had never been exposed to letters. Each day they soak up more knowledge and try their hardest to succeed. They are highly motivated to learn new things every day. We are halfway through the year and they are starting to take off. They know know all letters, some sight words, numbers to 20, and a majority of their letter sounds because of their hard work and determination. I am excited to see the places we will go from here!'"

       "'Super Sight Word Centers Most of my kindergarten students come from low-income households and are considered \\\\\"at-risk\\\\\". These kids walk to school alongside their parents and most have never been further than walking distance from their house. For 80% of my students, English is not their first language or the language spoken at home. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWhile my kindergarten kids have many obstacles in front of them, they come to school each day excited and ready to learn. Most students started the year out never being in a school setting. At the start of the year many had never been exposed to letters. Each day they soak up more knowledge and try their hardest to succeed. They are highly motivated to learn new things every day. We are halfway through the year and they are starting to take off. They know know all letters, some sight words, numbers to 20, and a majority of their letter sounds because of their hard work and determination. I am excited to see the places we will go from here! I currently have a differentiated sight word center that we do daily during our literacy stations. The students have activities that relate to whatever sight word list they are on. This is one of their favorite station activities. I want to continue to provide the students with engaging ways to practice their sight words. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nI dream of having the students use QR readers to scan the sight words that they are struggling with and the Ipods reading the sight words with them. This would help so many of my students by giving them multiple exposures to the words. My students need someone who can go over these sight words daily and I can\\'t always get around to everyone to practice their flashcards with them. With the Ipods they would still have a way to practice their sight words on a daily basis.  '"

       "'Watch Readers Grow! During our reading workshop students are at daily 5. My students need activities to help them practice skills in a fun and enjoyable way that is on the level of each child. As the teacher I enjoy conferencing with each student, so the more engaged the students are practicing the skills they. My students lack confidence. I have a class with such great potential. My students need more hands on learning and extra practice to catch and grow a love for reading. My second graders love to learn. We have resources but most are out dated. My students would be so bright if they could only build confidence. I believe in them and now I want to see them bloom. During our reading workshop. We do mini lessons that focus on a skill and then they rotate through daily 5 (centers). These reading activities will help them apply what they learned and reinforce the skills. They rotate through self read, buddy read (carpet) listening, writing,  word work (reading skills). If the class is actively engaged this leave more time for small group learning and conferencing with students. The giant magnet words will help at word work to build sentences and use the correct parts of speech. The classroom carpet will be for read to self where students can cozy up with a good book. Read with a pen close reads will be used during buddy read where students can zoom into the meanings and what is being read. The language skill center and quick picks will be used for our writing center and will help students with the skills they need to be great writers. All these materials will help my students grow doing our daily readers workshop. Your donations would greatly be a blessing for all my students. They focus on all the daily 5 rotations as well as help them grow. These reading activities will keep students engaged so the teacher can work and help students master the skills they are week in. The reading genre carpet will be used to enjoy a cozy place to sit and read. The close reads will be at buddy read so that students can help each other focus on what is being read. Thank you in advance for helping them grow as reader.'"
